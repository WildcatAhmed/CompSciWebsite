<title>History of Hotdogs & Their Impact onto the World</title>
<h1>The Origin</h1>
<p>The hotdog began with its weiner. Created in Frankfurt, Germany, the <i>Frankfurter WÃ¼rstchen</i>, or pork sausage was eaten by itself and was used for coronations as gifts. 
The weiner is actually from a different food; The Vienna sausage from <i>Vienna, Austria</i>. Which is a sausage, but with a mixture of pork and beef.
The beginnings of placing the sausage in a bun is unknown, but there are some theories. Harry M. Stevens is believed to have put the sausage in a bun on New York Polo Grounds in 1901.
The motivation for this was due to a loss of wax paper, and Stevens decided to perservere by using French rolls to hold the bun. The Midwest believes that Feuchtwanger, a German immigrant pioneereed the act.
Feuchtwanger ran a business on the streets of <i>St. Louis, Missouri</i>, where he sold sausages, but his workers were stealing the gloves being used to hold the hot sausages and this caused Feuchtwanger to lose money,
so his wife proposed using buns to hold the sausage. There is another itteration of this story where Feuchtwanger sold sausages at the World Fair-either the one in St, Louis in 1904, or Chicago in 1893-,
and his workers were stealing the gloves as souvenirs, so Feuchtwanger introduced using buns to hold the sausage.</p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>Nowadays, the hotdog is enjoyed world wide, and served in a multitude of different ways due to the variety of condiments we have. We see hotdog venders on the street in a lot of big cities like LA, and NYC.
To the point where people even go to NYC to try out the hotdog.
